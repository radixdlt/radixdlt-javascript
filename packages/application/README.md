# `RadixT`

All interactions with the Radix ledger is exposed via the reactive interface `Radix` (of type `RadixT`) - built with [RxJS 7 Beta (v13)](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#700-beta13-2021-03-15). Let's see an example of how everything "just works" thanks to using RxJS.

In the code block above we create a `RadixT` instance and provide it with a [Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) by loading a keystore using a function of type `() => Promise<KeystoreT>` (above named `loadKeystore`). After the keystore has been loaded, it will be decrypted using the provided password and create a wallet value (of type `WalletT`). Which the RadixT type will use internally to manage accounts and expose method for creating new ones. **By default an initial account will be derived automatically**<sup id="defaultDerivationPath">[1](#defaultDerivationPath)</sup>. 

Lastly we [`subscribe`](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/observable#subscribing-to-observables) to the reactive stream `tokenBalances` which will automatically fetch and update the token balances for the address of the active "account". Since the Radix Ledger [supports multiple tokens](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) for each address this will be a list of tokens, the [amount](https://github.com/radixdlt/radixdlt-javascript/blob/main/packages/primitives/src/_types.ts#L33-L48), their symbol ("ticker") and name. 

> üí° Friendly reminder: the observables will not start emitting values until you have subscribed to them

> üí° Friendly reminder: make sure to handle the returned value of the `subscribe()` function, by adding then to a [`Subscription`](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/subscription) object, otherwise behaviour is undefined and you might experience all sorts of weird errors (e.g. memory leaks).
> 

However, we can also interact with the [Radix Core API](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) without using any wallet, using the property `api`, like so:

```typescript
const subs = new Subscription()

const radix = Radix.create()
	.connect(new URL('https://api.radixdlt.com'))
	.setLogLevel(LogLevel.INFO)
	.ledger // accessing all RPC methods
	.nativeToken() // get token info about "XRD"
	.subscribe()
	.add(subs)

/* In the near future... */
// "üíô got nativeToken response: {
//      "name": "Rads",
//      "resourceIdentifier": "/9SAU2m7yis9iE5u2L44poZ6rYf5JiTAN6GtiRnsBk6JnXoMoAdks/XRD",
//      "symbol": "XRD",
//      "description": "The native currency of the Radix network",
//      "granularity": "1",
//      "hasMutableSupply": false,
//      "currentSupply": "12000000000",
//      "url": "https://https://www.radixdlt.com/",
//      "tokenUrl": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34097377?s=280&v=4",
//      "tokenPermission": { "burn": "NONE", "mint": "NONE" }
// } "
```

In the code block above we did not provide any wallet and notice we access the property `ledger`, on which we called the method `nativeToken()` which observable stream we subsequently subscribe to. Lastly we handle the subscription. If we were to set the log level to `INFO` (from default of `WARNING`), we would not have seen the output `"üíô got nativeToken response..."`, neither would we if we wouldn't have called `subscribe()`, since all observables returned by _function calls_ are **lazy** (using [`defer`](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/api/index/function/defer)).

> üí° Everytime you'll see a heart emoji üíúüíöüíôüíõ‚ù§Ô∏è it's a message logged from within this library (inspired by [SwiftBeaver](https://github.com/SwiftyBeaver/SwiftyBeaver#during-development-colored-logging-to-xcode-console)), representing `VERBOSE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING` and `ERROR` log levels respectively.

The [`ledger` property is separately documented in the end of this document](#ledger)

# Reactive properties

In a GUI wallet you will most likely not use `radix.ledger` so much, but rather all the reactive properties (Observable variables) on the `radix` value directly. 

## Immortal state listeners

If any error where to be emitted on these reactive properties, they would complete (terminate), and you would miss out on any subsequently emitted value. We don't want that, why we've made sure that these never emit any value. All errors are redirected to the specific `errors` property, but [more about that later](#errors-sink). For now just remember that you will always get the latest and greatest data given the current active account from the `radix` interface.

### Active address
We can subscribe to the active address, which will emit the formatted radix public address of the active account.

If we create and switch to a new account, we will see how both our active address and our token balances would update automatically.

```typescript
radix.activeAddress.subscribe(
	(address) => console.log(`üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è my address is: '${address.toString()}'`)
).add(subs)

/* Instant */
// "üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è my address is: '9S8khLHZa6FsyGo634xQo9QwLgSHGpXHHW764D5mPYBcrnfZV6RT'"

radix.deriveNextAccount({ alsoSwitchTo: true })

/* In the near future... */
// "üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è my address is: '9S8PWQF9smUics1sZEo7CrYgKgCkcopvt9HfWJMTrtPyV2rg7RAG'"

// "üíé My token balances:
// [ 
//      237.0 'xwETH' ("Radix-Wrapped Ether")
// ]"
```

We subscribe to `activeAddress` which will automatically update with the address of our active "account". We will instantly see our initial account having address ending with _"6RT"_ logged, since we already have an active account. Moments later we create a new account and also switched to it. Since we have subscribed to both `tokenBalances` and `activeAddres`, this will emit the token balances of the new account as well as the address of the new account. 

If we would have called `deriveNextAccount` without the `{ alsoSwitchTo: true }` argument we wouldn't have had switched account and we wouldn't have seen the print `"üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è my address is: '9S8P...7RAG'"`, because a new value would not have been emitted on the `activeAddress` reactive property, we would have simple derived a new latent account that we can switch to at a later point. More about [account switching here](#account-switching), more about [account derivation here](#account-derivation).

#### Universe Magic

A radix public address is the base58 encoding of two pieces of information:
`UniverseMagicByte || PublicKey` plus some checksum bytes. The `UniverseMagicByte` or just `Magic` is an integer uniquely identifying the network. Which will have different values for e.g. our betanet and mainnet, thus we must know the universe magic before we can derive any Radix addresses from a public key. The implications of this is that the `activeAddress` property will not emit any value until we have fetched the universe magic from a node.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è `activeAddress` will not emit any address until you have called connected to a node.

### Account listing

We can subscribe to all our accounts and list them using the observable property `accounts`, like so:

```typescript
radix.accounts.subscribe(
	(accounts) => console.log(`[üôãüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è] my accounts are: ${accounts.toString()}`)
).add(subs)

/* Instant */
// "[üôãüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è] my accounts are: [
//      {
//          hdPath: "m/44'/536'/0'/0/0'"
//      },
//      {
//          hdPath: "m/44'/536'/0'/0/1'"
//      },
// ]
```

Well, that is not helpful! What are those? An account (of type `AccountT`) itself is not so user-friendly or beautiful to look at, it holds a reference to the derivation path used to derive it, and is in itself mostly a collection of functions. So printing them our in a console like this is not so helpful. However, when building a GUI wallet, we can display a clickable dropdown list of accounts and when a user selects an account we should switch to it. You can read about [account switching](#Account-switching) further down.

#### Active account
You can also subscribe to just the single active account

```typescript
radix.activeAccount.subscribe(
	(account) => console.log(`üôãüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è my active account: ${account.toString()}`)
).add(subs)

/* Instant */
// "üôãüèº‚Äç my active account: {
//  hdPath: "m/44'/536'/0'/0/0'"
// },
```

The `activeAccount` is probably not so useful, better to use the `activeAddress` and `accounts` properties

### Token Balances

In [the intro](#intro) we subscribed to the `tokenBalances`. This will get updated automatically when you switch account.

```typescript
radix
	.tokenBalances
	.subscribe((tokenBalances) => {
		console.log(`üíé: ${tokenBalances.toString()}`)
	}
).add(subs)

/* In the near future... */
// "üíé My token balances:
// [ 
//      5.37 'rwBTC' ("Radix-Wrapped Bitcoin")
// ]"

// Later
radix
	.deriveNextAccount({ alsoSwitchTo: true })

/* In the near future... */
// "üíé My token balances:
// [ 
//      8541.37 'rwETH' ("Radix-Wrapped Ether")
// ]"
```

See (Fetch Trigger)[#fetchTrigger] for a way either scheduling fetching of token balances on a regular interval, or binding a fetch to a "Fetch Now" button in GUI.

## Errors sink

Since RxJS observable finishes on error, and would stop emitting values after an error, we have made sure all errors are caught and redirected to the `errors` property (of type `Observable<ErrorNotification>). Meaning that all reactive properties you can listen for values on are immortal.

Apart from logging (controlled with the `setLogLevel` method as seen in [intro](#intro) and [documented below](#setloglevel)) it is probably a good idea to listen to errors and handle them appropriately. To be clear, **you probably should _act upon_ these errors**, either you self as a developer or prompt user for action.

```typescript
radix.errors.subscribe(
	(errorNotification) => { 
		console.log(`‚ò£Ô∏è error ${error.toString()}`)
		// Maybe tot only log, but also act upon...	
	},
)

// "‚ò£Ô∏è error { 'tag': 'node', msg: 'Invalid SSL certificate' }"
// "‚ò£Ô∏è error { 'tag': 'wallet', msg: 'Failed to decrypt wallet' }"
// "‚ò£Ô∏è error { 'tag': 'api', msg: 'Request timed out' }"
```

Please note that the above code is in fact doing this (being explicit and correct):

```typescript
radix.errors.subscribe({
	next: (errorNotification) => console.log(errorNotification),
})
```

Which is **not** the same as:

```typescript
radix.errors.subscribe({
	error: (errorNotification) => console.log(errorNotification),
})
```

The `radix.errors` reactive property is in itself immortal and will never error out, so do **not** add a subscriber to the `error` event, but rather the `next` event**s**.

### Error "categories"
The `errors` property emits three different category of errors, each error is tagged with a 'category', each can be regarded as a separate error channel/stream and you can choose to split it into separate channels if you'd like.

```typescript
import { Observable } from 'rxjs'
import { ErrorNotification, WalletError, ErrorNotification } from '@radixdlt/application'

const splitErrorNotificationsOnCategory = <Category extends ErrorCategory>(category: Category): Observable<ErrorNotificationT> => radix.errors.pipe(
	filter((errorNotification) => errorNotification.category === category),
)

const walletErrors = splitErrorNotificationsOnCategory(ErrorCategory.WALLET)

walletErrors.subscribe(
	(errorNotification) => {
		if (errorNotification.cause === WalletErrorCause.LOAD_KEYSTORE_FAILED) {
			console.log(`‚ö†Ô∏è failed to load keystore: '${errorNotification.message}'`)
			// Aslo display error message in GUI.
		}
	}
)
```

You can access the underlying error `cause` and even `message` with more details.

# Methods

## Local methods

None of these methods will result in any RPC call to the Radix Core API. All methods perform local computation only.

### setLogLevel

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Not yet implemented, subject to change.

Sets the log level of the internal logger of this SDK. We use [roarr](https://github.com/gajus/roarr). By default, only error and warning logs will visible to you. Lower the log level to see more information.

### Account derivation
You can create new accounts with `deriveNextAccount()` call, which takes an optional argument, which contains in itself two optional arguments: 

```typescript
{
	isHardened?: boolean // Optional, defaults to true
	alsoSwitchTo?: boolean // Optional, defaults to false
}
```

We have already seen `alsoSwitchTo`, which changes the current active account. The `isHardened` controls whether the derived child key pair should be [hardened (not-extended) or not](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki#extended-keys). You probably don't need to worry about that, just leave it blank.

If you build a GUI wallet you probably want to **locally save** either a list of the derived accounts, i.e. their hdpaths or you might want to save the account with the highest value (the index of the last one), so that you can restore them upon app start.

For your convenience we provide you with a specific method for this

#### restoreAccountsUpToIndex

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Not yet implemented, subject to change.

You can "restore" all accounts up to some last known index. This does **not** switch the active account. If you passed in the value `0` nothing will happen.

```typescript
const localStore = localPersistentStoreAt('some/local/path') // or similar
const lastAccountIndex: number = localStore.loadLastAccountIndex() //  or similar

radix.accounts.subscribe(
	(accounts) => console.log(`üôãüèæ‚Äç[] I have #${accounts.length} accounts`)
).add(subs)

radix
	.restoreAccountsUpToIndex(lastAccountIndex)
	.subscribe({
		complete: () => console.log(`‚úÖ Finished restoring accounts`)
	})
	.add(subs)


/* Later */
// "üôãüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è[] I have #10 accounts"
// "‚úÖ Finished restoring accounts"
```

### Account switching

```typescript
radix
	.switchAccount('first')
	.switchAccount({ toIndex: 1 })
	.switchAccount({ toIndex: 0 })
	.switchAccount('last')

/* Instant */
// "üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è my address is: '9S8k...V6RT'"
// "üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è my address is: '9S8P...7RAG'"
// "üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è my address is: '9S8k...V6RT'"
// "üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è my address is: '9S8P...7RAG'"
```

A GUI wallet would probably want to send in the selected account (of type `AccountT`) rather than use `'first' | 'last' | { toIndex: number }` though. Which looks like this:

```typescript
const selectedAccount: AccountT = accountListInGUI.selectedItem() // or similar
radix.switchAccount({ toAccount: selectedAccount })

/* Instant */
// "üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è my address is: <THE_ADDRESS_OF_THE_SELECTED_ACCOUNT>"
```

TODO: üëÄ we might want to make it possible to give each account a human-readable name, or that might be something a GUI wallet _should_ be responsible for.

### Fetch trigger

‚ö†Ô∏è Not yet implemented, subject to change.

You can specify a fetch trigger (polling), by use of `withFetchTrigger` method.

```typescript
import { timer } from 'rxjs'

radix
	.withFetchTrigger({
		trigger: timer(3 * 60 * 1_000), // every third minute
		fetch: {
			tokenBalances: true,
			transactionHistory: false,
		}
	})
```

The above code will make sure you automatically perform a fetch of token balances every third minute. If you change from `transactionHistory: false` to `transactionHistory: true`, also transaction history will be fetched with the same interval.

```typescript
import { Subject } from 'rxjs'

const fetchNowSubject = new Subject<void>()
const trigger = merge(
	timer(3 * 60 * 1_000), // every third minute,
	fetchNowSubject
)

radix
	.withFetchTrigger({
		trigger,
		fetch: {
			tokenBalances: true,
			transactionHistory: true,
		}
	})

// If you "bind" a "Fetch Now"-button in GUI to call `next` on the subject
// this will trigger a fetch
fetchNowSubject.next(undefined) 
```


### Decrypt

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Not yet implemented, subject to change.

You can decrypt encrypted messages using the private key of the active account in transactions like so:

```typescript
radix
	.decryptMessageInTransaction(transaction)
	.subscribe({
		next: (decrypted) => { console.log(`‚úÖüîì successfully decrypted message: ${decrypted.message.toString()}`) },
		error: (failure) => { console.log(`‚ùåüîê failed to decrypt message, wrong account? ${failure.toString()}`) },
	})
	.add(subs)
```

### Sign

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Not yet implemented, subject to change.

You can sign arbitrary data using the private key of the active account, typically you will not use this since you will use higher level method `transferTokens` which also handles the signing part. This should be considered a more low level API for signing generic data.

```typescript
radix
	.wallet
	.sign({ unhashed: 'I approve of this message.'.toString('hex')}) // will sha256 hash
	.subscribe(
		(signed) => console.log(`üìù 
			signed message '${signed.message.toString()}', 
			with related private key of public key: ${signed.publicKey.toString()}, 
			resulting in signature: '${signed.signature.toString()}'
		`)
	)
	.add(subs)
```


## Methods resulting in RPC calls

### Transaction history

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Not yet implemented, subject to change.

A transaction is not a token transfer, but a token transfer might be one action amongst many in a transaction.

As opposed to the three reactive _properties_ `activeAddress`, `tokenBalances`, `accounts` that we have examined so far, you **cannot** subscribe to the transaction history using a _property_. The reason for this is that the transaction history might be long, and is for that sake paginated. So `RadixT` needs some kind of _"cursor"_ together with a `size`, telling it where and how many transactions to fetch from the Radix Distributed Ledger. 

```typescript
radix.transactionHistory({
	size: 3,
}).subscribe(
	(txs) => console.log(`üìí‚è± transaction history: ${txs.toString()} ‚è±üìí`)
).add(subs)

/* In the near future... */
// "üìí‚è± transaction history: 
//	{
//		"cursor": "FadedBeeFadedBeeFadedBeeFadedBeeFadedBeeFadedBeeFadedBeeFadedBee",
//		"transactions": [

//		]
//	}
// ‚è±üìí
// "
```

Wow üòÖ, that's a mouthful... Let's break it down. We call subscribe to the observable returned by the method call to `transactionHistory(...)` and after a short delay log the received object. It contains some "cursor", being a pointer to the last transaction, we can use this for subsequent pagination pages. We also see an array of "transactions". Each transaction has:  
1. An identifier.  
2. A type (`incoming`, `outgoing` or `unrelated`).
3. A date.  
4. A token fee (paid in the native token ("Rad"/`XRD`)).  
5. An **optional**, encrypted, message.
6. A list of actions, more about [these below](#actions).

In the example above we asked for `3` transactions and got (indeed) got three, since there were at least three incoming/outgoing to/from the active account. If we had asked for let's say `1000` and we only owned `42`, then only 42 would have been returned of course.

We also saw that the first transaction had a "message", but not the other two, it is completely optional, and bound to the transaction itself, not a particular action. We were also unable to read the message, since it is encrypted. **Messages are _not_ decrypted automatically when received**, you have to manual ask for a message to be decrypted, typically when displaying detailed information about the containing transaction, but more about [decryption later](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ).

You ought to keep track of the returned `cursor` value in the `transactionHistory` response, since you can use that you query the next "page", like so:


```typescript

import { Option, none } from 'prelude-ts'
import { AtomIdentifierT } from '@radixdlt/application'
import { Subject } from 'rxjs'

const cursor: Option<AtomIdentifierT> = none()
const fetchTXTrigger = new Subject<number>()

fetchTXTrigger.pipe(
	mergeMap((pageSize) => {
		radix.transactionHistory({
			size: pageSize,
			cursor: cursor.getOrNull()
		})
	})
).subscribe(
	(txs) => { 
		cursor = Option.of(txs.cursor)
		console.log(`üìíüìÉ got #${txs.size} transactions`)
	}
).add(subs)

fetchTXTrigger.next(20) // fetch tx 0-19
fetchTXTrigger.next(20) // fetch tx 20-33

/* In the near future... */
// üìíüìÉ got #20 transactions
// üìíüìÉ got #14 transactions
```

In the code block above we use `cursor` to fetch two different "pages" of the transaction history, but this account only had 34 transactions, so the second page only contained 14 entries.

We use a [Subject (RxJS)](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/subject) to trigger the multiple calls to `transactionHistory`, in combination with [`mergeMap` ("flatMap)](https://www.learnrxjs.io/learn-rxjs/operators/transformation/mergemap) to transform the observable from `number => TransactionHistory` . An important thing to note is that we *update the cursor upon receiving each new "page"*.

See (Fetch Trigger)[#fetchTrigger] for a way either scheduling fetching of transaction history a regular interval, or binding a fetch to a "Fetch Now" button in GUI.


### Actions

#### `TokenTransfer`
A transfer of some tokens, of a specific amount. This is probably the most relevant action.

#### `StakeTokens`
Staking tokens.

#### `UnstakeTokens`
Unstake tokens

#### `ClaimEmissionReward`
Claim emission reward.

#### `BurnTokens`
Burn tokens.

#### `MintTokens`
Burn tokens.

#### `Unknown`
The Radix Core API failed to recognize the instructions as a well-formed/well-known canonical action. Will reveal low-level constructs named "particles". For more info, see the [Atom Model]((https://dev.to/radixdlt/knowledgebase-update-atom-model-263i)).


## Transfer Tokens

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Not yet implemented, subject to change.

### Transfer input

Let us transfer some tokens! All methods accept specific types such as `AddressT` for recipient address, `AmountT` for token amounts and `ResourceIdentierT` for token asset identifier. All these will have been exposed to you already via `tokenBalances`, `ledger.nativeToken()` and/or `transactionHistory`.

> üí° Amount of tokens to send must be a multiple of the token's granularity

You can read out the _granularity_ (of type `AmountT`) from the token info, by using `radix.ledger.tokenInfo(tokenResourceIdentifier)`.

You will also need to make sure to correctly translate unsafe user input into these safe types.

```typescript
import { Amount } from '@radixdlt/primitives'
import { Address } from '@radixdlt/account'
import { Transaction } from '@radixdlt/application'

const recipientAddressString = recipientTextField.value() // or similar
const recipientAddressResult = Address.fromBase58String(recipientAddressString)
if (recipientAddressResult.isErr()) {
	console.log(`Invalid addres string, error: ${recipientAddressResult.error.message}`)
}
const recipientAddress: AddressT = recipientAddressResult.value

const fooToken: ResourceIdentifierT = selectedToken.id // or similar, read from `tokenBalances`.
const tokenGranularity = radix.ledger
	.tokenInfo(fooToken)
	.subscribe((token) => {
		console.log(`üî∂üü†üî∏ granularity of token ${token.name} : ${token.granularity.toString()}, any transfer of this token MUST be a multiple of this amount.`)
	}).add(subs)
	
// Later when we know granularity of token.

const amountString = amountTextField.value() // or similar
const amountResult = Amount.fromUnsafe(amountString)
if (amountResult.isErr()) {
	console.log(`Invalid amount string, did you input a number?`)
}
const unsafeAmount: AmmountT = amountResult.value

if (!unsafeAmount.isMultipleOf(granularity)) {
	console.log(`‚ö†Ô∏è requested amount to send is not a mulltiple of token granularity, will be unable to send`)
	// üí° also inform user in GUI
	// Abort token sending
}

// ‚òëÔ∏è Amount is checked against token granularity, safe to send.
const amount = unsafeAmount
```

### Transaction Flow Summary

1. Gather and transform unsafe inputs into validated and type safe values.
2. Create a transaction intent (may contain multiple actions), no fee is specified.
3. From Radix Core API fetch transaction (including fee) translated from intent. Upon response JS lib  performs some soundness check that the content of the transaction matches the intent (TBD).
4. A ready-to-be-signed transaction (including human-readable fee) is returned to the GUI wallet.  
5. The GUI wallet tells JS lib to sign and submit the transaction to the Radix Core API.
6. Tbe JS lib immediately returns the actual transaction id (`txId`), back to the GUI wallet (which it was able to compute locally since it has the signature now.)
7. GUI wallet tells JS lib to poll status of transaction using the `txId` from last step.


### Transaction flow pseudocode (`Promise`)

Here is a *concept* of the flow, using `await` syntax. This is **not** the actual API, it's mere *pseudocode* to help visualize the flow. Since transfer of tokens is a multi-stage rocket, there are many things to keep track of. 

```typescript
// ‚õîÔ∏è‚õîÔ∏è‚õîÔ∏è NOT THE ACTUAL API ‚õîÔ∏è‚õîÔ∏è‚õîÔ∏è
// THIS IS JUST AN OUTLINE OF FLOW
// Step 1Ô∏è‚É£ Gather and transform unsafe inputs into validated and type safe values. Already done in code block above

// Step 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a transaction intent (may contain multiple actions), no fee is specified.
const transactionIntent = TransactionIntent.create()
	.transferTokens({
		to: recipientAddress,
		amount: amount,
		token: fooToken
	})
	.message(`Thx for lunch Bob, here's for my salad.`)

// 3Ô∏è‚É£ From API fetch transaction (incl fee)
const unsignedTransactionWithReadableFee = await radix.transactionFrom({ 
	intent: intent
})

// 4Ô∏è‚É£ GUI wallet now has access to ready-to-be-signed transaction with human readable fee

// 5Ô∏è‚É£ GUI wallet tells JS lib to sign and submit blob/transaction to the Radix Core API.

// 6Ô∏è‚É£ JS lib immeediatly returns the actual transaction id 
const transactionId = await radix.signAndSubmitTransaction(
	unsignedTransaction
)

// 7Ô∏è‚É£ GUI wallet tells JS lib to poll status of transaction using the txId from last step.
radix.ledger.statusOfTransactionById(transactionId)
	
// üß© And when returned transaction status is `CONFIRMED` or `REJECTED` we know that the transaction is complete. Update UI accordingly.

// THIS IS JUST AN OUTLINE OF FLOW
// ‚õîÔ∏è‚õîÔ∏è‚õîÔ∏è NOT THE ACTUAL API ‚õîÔ∏è‚õîÔ∏è‚õîÔ∏è
```

# Ledger
This outlines all the requests you can make to the Radix Core API. All these requests are completely independent of any wallet, thus they have no notion of any "active address".

### `tokenBalancesForAddress`
```typescript
tokenBalancesForAddress: (address: AddressT) => Observable<TokenBalances>
```

### `executedTransactions`
```typescript
executedTransactions: (
	input: Readonly<{
		address: AddressT

		// pagination
		size: number // must be larger than 0
		cursor?: AtomIdentifierT
	}>,
) => Observable<ExecutedTransactions>
```

### `nativeToken`
```typescript
nativeToken: () => Observable<Token>
```

### `tokenInfo`
```typescript
tokenInfo: (resourceIdentifier: ResourceIdentifierT) => Observable<Token>
```

### `tokenFeeForTransaction`

```typescript
tokenFeeForTransaction: (transaction: Transaction) => Observable<TokenFeeForTransaction>
```

### `stakesForAddress`
```typescript
stakesForAddress: (address: AddressT) => Observable<Stakes>
```

### `transactionStatus`
```typescript
transactionStatus: (id: AtomIdentifierT) => Observable<TransactionStatus>
```

### `networkTransactionThroughput`
```typescript
networkTransactionThroughput: () => Observable<NetworkTransactionThroughput>
```

### `networkTransactionDemand`
```typescript
networkTransactionDemand: () => Observable<NetworkTransactionDemand>
```

### `getAtomForTransaction`
```typescript
getAtomForTransaction: (
	transaction: Transaction,
) => Observable<AtomFromTransactionResponse>
```

### `submitSignedAtom`
```typescript
submitSignedAtom: (
	signedAtom: SignedAtom,
) => Observable<SubmittedAtomResponse>
```

# Unsubscribe

> üí° Friendly reminder: when deemed appropriate, dispose of tour subscriptions by `unsubscribe`

It's impossible to say when appropriate, that is up to you.

```typescript
// Earlier
const subs = new Subscription()

// Sometime you did
someObservable.subscribe().add(subs)

// Later
subs.unsubscribe()
```
